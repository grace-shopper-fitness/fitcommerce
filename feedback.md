- You should never have more closed pull requests (PRs) than issues
- Standardize commit message style more, maybe go with https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages
- Contribution guide!
- README!
- Remove .DS_Store from github repo, via gitignore
- Inconsistent code styling (e.g. semicolons)
- Recommend eslintrc
- Recommend moving index.scss out of public (it's not a static resource requested by the client directly)
- Tests!
- Test as you go
- If you find yourself "manually" testing (e.g. with postman), perfect place where yo might use automated tests (e.g. with supertest)
- Consider using order only, instead of cart and order models
